****Executive Summary****

This project does Principle Component Analysis (PCA) on the a Wine and Yeast data set's from Kaggle.
PCA is a statistical procedure that takes correlated values and converts them to 
new variables called principle components. The first component has the largest variation, which can 
mean those have the largest variation.

To see the PCA simply run either python file pca_wine for the wine.data or the 
pca_yeast for the yeast.data set.
